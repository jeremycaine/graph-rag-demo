RAG Demo - Quick Start Guide
============================

1. SETUP (run once):
   bash setup.sh

2. SET API KEY:
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='sk-ant-...'
   
   Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/

3. RUN THE DEMO:
   source venv/bin/activate
   python rag_demo.py

4. WHEN DONE:
   deactivate

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set": Make sure you ran step 2
- If "module not found": Make sure virtual environment is activated
- If download fails: The script will use a fallback sample text

WHAT TO EXPECT:
The demo will show you 3 questions answered two ways:
- Without RAG (vanilla LLM - may hallucinate or lack specifics)
- With RAG (retrieves actual speech excerpts first - accurate!)

You'll clearly see why RAG makes responses better! 🚀
